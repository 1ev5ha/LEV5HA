## About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I have loved the IT industry since childhood. During my school years, I loved creating animations in Macromedia Dremweawer and writing in HTML.<br>
Adulthood has set priorities in its own way.<br>
The main priority is work in the specialty. In the field of industrial construction. Control engineer.<br>
Secondary direction: freelancing, web development on constructors (Tilda, Nethouse), SEO-optimization, advertising. For small and medium businesses.<br>
First, COVID changed the world, burnout at work, and after the military conflict affected my priorities...
